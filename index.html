        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img class="profile-image" src="assets/Images/kk-profile.jpg" alt="Kurtis Kovel Snowboarding">
        <p>I was born in 1989 in Charlotte North Carolina. I currently live east of the city in a small town called Midland with my girlfriend Heather and our two dogs Jango and Riley. When I am not coding, I am typically gaming with friends or playing sports such as football, basketball, soccer, golf and snowboarding. I attended ITT Technical Institute where I received an associated degree in Graphic Design. <br>Carolina Digital Photo, one of my freelance web development clients became my first industry related position as a Photoshop expert. The experience I gained there landed me a role in the E-Commerce Department at Belk as a Product Image Producer. After a year I was promoted to the Department Landing Page team where we used HTML and CSS to update numerous pages on the website. After parting ways with Belk I have been working with my own clients to improve their knowledge of HTML, CSS, compliance and best practices.</p>
